/**
 * Unified trade policy — the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for multiplayer trade.
 *
 * In multiplayer, trade eligibility depends on multiple factors:
 * - City type (AI vs player-owned)
 * - Route state (active/disabled/offline)
 * - Resource settings (import/export toggles, stockpile thresholds)
 * - Trade view data (for remote player cities)
 *
 * This module provides a canonical query API so no caller needs to
 * assemble the answer from multiple scattered sources.
 *
 * Mutation flow:
 *   1. Player changes resource setting (import/export/stockpile)
 *   2. Change is applied locally AND sent to host via command_bus
 *   3. Host validates and broadcasts to all peers
 *   4. Peers update their trade views for that player's city
 *   5. Next trade eligibility query reflects the change
